# Project Overview

# A.PLANNING THE PROJECT


### **Project Management Life Cycle**
In project management, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a very important tool 
because it provides the basis for deciding how to do the work. The WBS also provides a basis 
for creating the project schedule and performing earned value management for measuring and 
forecasting project performance.


The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart which
allows staff to follow the guidelines and achieved the milestone from time to time. The project
life cycle WBS breakdown the task and work of every members such as project manager into several modules. Every member have their own roles and part in every stage of the lifecyle based on the constructed WBS.
.In the Gantt chart, the processes included are initiating 
process, planning process, executing process, monitoring and controlling process, and lastly 
closing process.

Project Management is shown in the table below:

As for the Face Recognition Project, the system WBS are represented as follow. This WBS is constructured to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as Face Detection, Face Recognition, interface design and API management:

### **Risk Identification Chart (Quality,Cost,Time)**
| CONTROL ELEMENT | ISSUE | SITUATION | DISCLOSURE |
| ---         |     ---      |          --- |          --- | 
|  *QUALITY* <br> ((Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program))   | 1.	Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: Facial Recognition systems can be impacted by poor lighting or low image quality. The data may not match up with the person’s nodal points because of camera angles being obscured; this creates an error when matching faceprints cannot be verified in the database. <br> <br> 2.	 Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The relative angle of the target's face has a significant impact on the recognition score. Usually, several angles are employed when enrolling a face in the facial recognition software (profile, frontal and 45-degree are common). Anything less than a frontal view affects the algorithm’s capability to generate a template for the face. The more direct the image and the higher its resolution, the higher the score of any resulting matches.| How: The output result tends to unrecognize or wrongly recognized people faces. <br> <br> When: The quality problem of will be determined during the unit testing phase | Assign one member to purchase a good quality camera and get a good lighting tools so that the outcome will be satisfied. |
| *COST* <br>  (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency) | 1. Contigency: If one of the team members damages the camera or lighting equipment, the cost of the items will go up. <br> <br>2. Inadequate productivity: Team members who were impacted by COVID-19 and were unable to deliver what they were expected to deliver, which resulted in additional costs, need to be budgeted for the same equipment.      | git diff      | git status    |
| *TIME* <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products)     | git diff       | git diff      | git status    |
