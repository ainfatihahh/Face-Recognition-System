# Deliverables:
Software Requirements: 
1.	A **Linux-Based Operating System** to deploy and operate facial recognition algorithms.
2.	A **User-Interface Application** allow user to interact with the facial recognition system via devices.

# Hardware Requirements: 
1.	A **Camera** to capture facial images of users and used in identifying faces.
2.	A **laptop/PC** with operating system of Windows 10 and above.
3.	**Display Screen** to navigating user and displaying messages.

# Intelligence System Architectures:
One potential neural network architecture for a face recognition system is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are well-suited for image-based tasks such as facial recognition because they can extract useful features from the raw data and classify them based on patterns and structures present in the images.
