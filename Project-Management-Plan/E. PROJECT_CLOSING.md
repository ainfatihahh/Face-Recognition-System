## 3. Final Project Report

**1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES**
Face Recognition Attendance App is an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect face and display name to record the attendance. By using this system, organisations are able to identify users based on their facial features, making it more convenient for attandances for educational purposes or even to clock in and out at work.

**2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS**
After the system has been develop and completed, the accuracy reaches the highest percent than expected which is 98.78%

**3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE**
Our team complete the project within the scheduled timeline. The schedule is as below:

**4.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL BUDGET**
The actual budget matches the original budget, which means that the team has followed the budget planned at the beginning of the project and does not use any excessive money.

**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE**
The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. This system has been developed to focuse on making a face detection as a medium to take the  attendance of students especially for school and university purposes. Face detection and recognition have progressed from obscure to popular fields of computer vision research in the last decade, and is now one of the better and more effective applications of image analysis. Face recognition has been one of the most important areas in computer vision and image analysis in the last decade. In general, face detection is performed in real time in three scenarios: first, from a still image scene, second, from a stream of video scenes, and third, from scenes retrieved from stored databases to identify the person or persons.

**5.2 OBJECTIVES**
<br>1.To create a web-based system of Face Recognition that can take attendance 
<br>2. To create a web-based system that recognize their faces according to their name that are already registered in the database.
<br>3. To create a system that is able to record the details of the attendance that will display the date, time, and person's name.

**5.3 IMPACTS**
1.	Easy access to check the attendance list in the future compared to manual recording attendance.
2.	Able to determine the faces of people entering and exiting a specific place such as class to take attendance.
3.	Reduced the time consumed in taking attendance.

**6.0 TRANSITION PLAN**
FRST Inc. staff will provide support when require. The main work of support provided by FRST Inc.â€™s staff on the Face Recognition with Integrated Advanced Recognition system project are as shown below:
i) Keep the system running smoothly.
ii) Handling errors and updates of the system
iii) Give the owner of the house instructions on how to utilise the system
iv) Monthly information reporting to upper management
