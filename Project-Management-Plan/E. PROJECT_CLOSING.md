**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE**
The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. This system has been developed to identify and classify either it can access or not based on database and input that already make by users. For instance, the system not able to receive and store more than one data which is one person because of memory. It makes only owner of face recognition and fingerprint can access and make it limitation of system. But, the people who not registered in system can unlocked or access system by using password using keypad on system.

**5.2 OBJECTIVES**
1.	Improved security: The system can accurately identify users based on their facial features or fingerprint data, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access.
2.	Convenience: The system can quickly and easily identify users, eliminating the need to fumble with keys or remember a PIN code.
3.	Integration with other systems: The system can be integrated with other smart home or security systems, allowing for greater control and automation of the home or office.

**5.3 IMPACTS**
1.	Increased security: The system can help to prevent unauthorized access to a space, reducing the risk of break-ins or unauthorized entry.
2.	Improved convenience: The system can provide a more convenient and seamless experience for users, improving overall satisfaction and usability.
3.	Reduced risk of lock tampering: The system can detect and prevent tampering with the lock, reducing the risk of break-ins or unauthorized entry.
4.	**6.0 TRANSITION PLAN**
HanSen Inc. staff will provide support when require. The main work of support provided by HanSen Inc.â€™s staff on the Smart Lock with Integrated Advanced Recognition system project are as shown below:
i) Keep the system running smoothly.
ii) Handling errors and updates of the system
iii) Give the owner of the house instructions on how to utilise the system
iv) Monthly information reporting to upper management
