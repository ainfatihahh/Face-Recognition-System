**Project Summary**
Face Recognition is a system that is built and created as a process of recognizing the students face for taking attendance by using face biometrics. The system's goal is to make it easy for users to check whether students entering the class or not.  Instead of using the conventional methods, this proposed system aims to develop an automated system that records the studentâ€™s attendance by using facial recognition technology. The main objective of this project is to build a system that is integrated with Artificial Intelligence which make the attendance marking and management system efficient, time saving, simple and easy. The module to be developed are detection which it will build to detect people from a camera which it can identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face. The method used in this system are OpenCV and machine learning. The processed image will be compared to the already-stored record, and the database will then reflect the results of the comparison as attendance.

**Problem Statement**

Nowadays, educational institutions are concerned about student attendance 
consistency. Even in the midst of a pandemic, attendance remains a key concern. 
Calling out the roll call or having student to sign a piece of paper are the two most 
common ways of recording attendance. They were both more time consuming and 
challenging. As a result, a computer-based of taking student attendance in class
is required, which will assist institutions in automatically keeping attendance records.
Therefore, this project focuses on making a face detection as a medium to take the 
attendance of students.


**Objectives**
The objectives embarks on the following objectives:
  1. To develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect faces of people.
  2. To develop a system that are able to recognize the faces of people.
  3. To develop a system that can compared to the already-stored record, and the database will then reflect the results of the comparison as attendance
