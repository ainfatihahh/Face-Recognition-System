# Face-Recognition-System

Face recognition is a popular issue in computer vision research. In applications 
where humans interact with machines, human face detection has become increasingly 
significant. Face detection has numerous applications in real-time problem solving. 
Face detection is the process of identifying facial features in an image, such as the 
nose, hair, face skin, and eyes. Because of time-changing aspects such as expressions, 
illuminations, backdrop, and so on, recognising human faces is fairly tough. This 
system is built to help in solving major problem that can detect faces from a camera 
device to recognize people to be used for detection of human face.

This proposed system can be used to recognise people's faces in a variety of 
settings, including universities, schools, workplaces, railway stations, bus stations, and 
homes, and it distinguishes between people faces and signs. The system strategy will 
be effective in securing a attendances setting. It entirely eliminates unwanted entry caused 
by unauthorised people and aids in the security of the region.

Project management was able to implement a professionalised management model based on scientific literature in the context of this study, which helped to complete the project's objectives within the allotted time and scope. Additionally, it made it possible for professional commitment and communication to improve as they sought structure, agility, and high-quality outcomes.

The project is created by adhering to the PMP in order to better organise the project's lifecycle. The project is managed using a variety of charting tools, including Gantt charts, milestone charts, and work breakdown structures (WBS).
