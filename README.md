# Face-Recognition-System

Face recognition is a popular issue in computer vision research. In applications where humans interact with machines, human face detection has become increasingly  significant. Face detection has numerous applications in real-time problem solving. Face detection is the process of identifying facial features in an image, such as the 
nose, hair, face skin, and eyes. Because of time-changing aspects such as expressions, illuminations, backdrop, and so on, recognising human faces is fairly tough. This 
system is built to help in solving major problem that can detect faces from a camera device to recognize people to be used for detection of human face.
